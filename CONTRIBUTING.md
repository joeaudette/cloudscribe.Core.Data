# Contributing to cloudscribe

I would really welcome help in maintaining these ado data layers, so please contact me if interested at: info [at] cloudscribe.org

I've grown to love Entity Framework for the productivity, and keeping these multiple impplementations up to date has been a drag on evolving our models. By moving these implementations to a separate repository we can work at a faster cadence in the main repository using Entity Framework, and come back later and fill in the ADO.NET implementations as needed or requested.

I'm also interested in providing a MongoDb implemtation, if anyone wants to help with that please let me know. From examples I've seen of Mongo C# code it looks very similar to EF 7 code and would use the same models as all the other implementations.

I do intend to update some of these at various intervals myself, depending on demand, so please let us know if you are using a package that is not up to date with the cloudscribe.Core.Models data repository APIs. In some cases we might be able to prioritize a new nuget release to help you get an up to date version. 

This project is part of the cloudscribe set of projects which are all being managed under the same policies.
